					<h2>The Problem Space</h2>
                        <p>In 2018, there are 2 million people in the United States that are currently incarcerated. Of those 2 million 1,660,000 will return to prison within the next 5 years. However, if these individuals have access to the skill and knowledge to navigate technology, that number can be reduced by 43%. The Michigan Department of Corrections has recognized the need to include technology based education and has started to make a push to integrate it into prisons.</p> 
                        <p>The largest barrier for returning citizens is knowledge of and an understanding of technology, especially to find gainful employment.</p><br>

                    <h2>Data Synthesis</h2>
                        <ul>Existing educational programs in prison are formal and structured, but this rigidity allows for new programs to enter the learning environment</ul>
                        <ul>Tablets on restricted access servers are being introduced into prisons and as a result standardized test scores are improving</ul>
                        <ul>Without knowledge of technology skills it is difficult to access online digital literacy education resources</ul>
                        <ul>Upon release there are many barriers for reentering citizens that include things like signing up for food stamps, getting a state ID, etc. Due to the tangible and immediate outcomes of these task education becomes less salient. </ul>
